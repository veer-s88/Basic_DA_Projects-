# Portfolio_Projects

The first two projects are projects using Covid-19 dataset:

1. I first began by better understanding the data in SQL using pgAdmin and PostgreSQL, I wrote some queries to better understand the data and answer some questions, these queries are shown in the file Covid_Portfolio_Project_SQL_Queries

2.  I then used Tableau Public to a dashboard to show visualisations for the results of some of the queries mentioned in the previous file. The link for this dashboard is shown below:

3.  I then cleaned data from the nashville housing dataset using SQL. The SQL queries used to perform the cleaning operations are shown in the Data_Cleaning_Nashville_Housing file and the raw dataset used is seen in the csv file.
