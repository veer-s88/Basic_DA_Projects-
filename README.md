# COVID_Portfolio_Projects
Project for looking at and understanding COVID data using SQL, Tableau and Python for data analysis and visualisation

I first began y better understanding the data in SQL using pgAdmin and PostgreSQL, I wrote some queries to better understand the data and answer some questions, these queries are shown in the file Covid_Portfolio_Project_SQL_Queries

I then used Tableau Public to a dashboard to show visualisations for the results of some of the queries mentioned in the previous file. The link for this dashboard is shown below:
